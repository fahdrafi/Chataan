The Fed is working to &quot;level the playing field&quot; across countries and is using several international forums that bring together central banks and national regulators to strengthen to the global financial system, he said. The effort is just the latest of the &quot;international dimensions&quot; that the Fed has had to contend with over its 100-year history, Lacker said.
